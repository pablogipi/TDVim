===============================================================================

TDVim comes with some tools to integrate Houdini for both HDK (C++) and
Python developemnt.

In $TDVIMROOT/tools/ there is a script called buildHDKTags.cmd and
buildHDKTags.sh, depending of the platform.
This script will create tags for the HDK and the hou Python module.
Just run ii from a terminal setup for Houdini, basically it just need to have
$HFS setup correctly.

The you can use the project setup file, project.vim, to make the tag files
created available for C++ and Pthon.

In $TDVIMROOT/templates there is a template for project.vim which shows
how to integrate the tags files in the project.

With this setup correctly now it is possible to make tags lookups for the
Houdini develpment files.

The script will also create a Gtags, global tags, data base.

Another important point for Houdini development is how to open vim in order
to load the hou module inside Vim's python session.

To do that just setup you environment, terminal, so it extend the PYTHONPATH
variable to include Houdini's python libraries:
$HFS/houdini/python2.7libs .
Then double chekc that  the Python 2.7 loaded by VIM is the same platform
as Houdini, 32 or 64bits.

With all of these ready, then inside Houdini you should be able to run:
python import hou .

That means that Jedi should be now able to offer autocompletion for hou
members.

Finall to enable HDK tags and hou tags inside your project just add them 
to the `project.vim` script, something like this:


" CPP project settings: 
if &filetype == "cpp" || &filetype == "c"
    " Add tags HDK tags
    set tags+=hdk.tags

    " Set build command
    if utils#GetOS() == 3
        "Windows
        set makeprg="nmake"
    endif
endif

" Python project settings: 
if &filetype == "python"
    " Add tags HOU tags
    set tags+=hou.tags
endif
