  You will be asked for the preffered location, bing `HOME/TDVim`the defaul
  location.
- Copy a run script as your main vimrc, in linuxin `$HOME/.vim/vimrc`.

- Copy plugins is the user choose to do that.
  Plugins can be installed later running `PlugInstall`()
- Setup environment variable called `TDVIMROOT`point to the TDVim install
  location.
- User can optionally create a `$HOME/.myvimrc` to override any default setup
