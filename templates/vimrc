" Description: Minimal Vim setup used to run TDVim
" Last Change: June 19, 2012 - 02:19 AM

" You should have a proper TDVim setup to use this file.
" Refer to the installation docs in the Wiki about how to install
" TDVim in your system
"
" Set the runtime path to use look first into the TDVim distribution directory
" Sources the main TDVim startup file
" Finally tries to source the user vim configuration.
"
" So to setup TDVim you just only need to setup properly an environment
" variable called TDVIMROOT, which should point to the directory that contains
" the TDVim release.
" The user config usually is this same file $HOME/.vimrc, in UNIX, so to allow
" the user to make her/his own setup this script will try to load a file
" called .myvimrc in UNIX or _myvimrc in Windows.
